1.	For figures use “.pdf” instead of “.png” cuz it is higher quality. For {phase_roc_curve.pdf} use 0.65 width but increase the font size (ticks, labels, legend etc.). for {feature_categories_distribution.pdf} use 0.9 width, increase the font size and adjust the code so in the legend the names only included without the feature numbers such as “(4 features)”. For {shap_summary_global.pdf}, the width size of 0.85 is good but increase the font sizes. For {calibration_curves.pdf} use 0.95 width size and increase the font sizes. Remove figure titles from all figures except calibration_curves, because there are three figures in the subplot, so we need to know what is what. For all the figures, the first short sentence of the figure caption in bold should indicate the figure title. You need to make some of these changes in the main.tex and some in the figure related codes “train_ensemble_calibration.py” for new figure generation.
2.	In “While time-to-event models (e.g., Cox regression, survival analysis) offer valuable insights into healing duration distributions, they address a fundamentally different clinical question---estimating \textit{when} healing occurs rather than \textit{what happens} at the next visit.” I told you not to use “---” to separate sentences. Refere to the notes.md paper guidline section to refresh your memory. don’t \textit “when” and “what happens”.
3.	Remove this “Importantly, the model directly predicts transition categories as target labels rather than predicting healing phases followed by rule-based mapping; this end-to-end approach ensures that classification errors reflect model limitations rather than artifacts of post-hoc categorization rules.” This was my experimentation unrelated to the paper.
4.	There should be a better transition between these two points, going from choice of 21 and 42 days to comparasion with LSTM in “The transition category definitions themselves are grounded in established clinical evidence: prolonged inflammation thresholds ($>$21 days) reflect documented resolution timelines in diabetic wounds~\cite{guo2010factors}, while proliferative stagnation thresholds ($>$42 days) align with the 4--6 week prognostic window validated by Sheehan et al.~\cite{sheehan2003percent} and Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines~\cite{warriner2011wound}. While recurrent neural networks such as LSTM represent a natural architectural choice for sequential medical data, ensemble tree-based methods demonstrate superior performance on structured tabular datasets in small to moderate sample regimes \cite{grinsztajn2022tree,shwartz2022tabular}.”
5.	Can confirm these values in “1656 augmented transition samples from 595 original transitions”?
6.	In “unsupervised clustering identified fast-healer (40\%) and slow-healer (60\%) phenotypes that captured” can confirm the values?
7.	“Our 268-patient cohort,” confirm this value.
8.	This “such as DFUC2024” needs a citation.
9.	In “The dataset lacks vascular assessment parameters---neither quantitative measures (ankle-brachial index, toe pressures) nor clinical proxies (palpable pulses) were collected---which fundamentally” don’t use ---
10.	In “This omission was intentional: the study prioritized accessible metadata-based prediction for deployment in resource-constrained settings where vascular studies may be unavailable.” I wouldn’t call it intentional or the omission. Just say the focus of the dataset at the time of gathering was accessibility.
11.	“The dataset comprised 889 appointment records from 268 unique patients with 329 distinct DFUs.” Confirm these values.
12.	For “1,000 iterations, I actually did 2,000.
13.	This needs to be updated “For feature selection, an importance threshold approach based on SHAP values \cite{lundberg2017unified} was incorporated directly into the optimization process to select the essential features for achieving the highest performance.” I didn’t use shap for feature selection as we talked about it before.
14.	This part “Through this sequential data augmentation, the training set was expanded from 595 original transition samples to 1656 augmented samples (2.78$\times$ augmentation factor), with each sample constructed by pairing features from appointment $t$ with the healing phase outcome at appointment $t+1$. Ablation analysis confirmed that augmentation improves both classification and calibration performance: without augmentation, F1-macro decreased from 0.77 to 0.74, ECE increased from 0.07 to 0.10, and ROC-AUC decreased from 0.90 to 0.87.” should be in results, not methods section.
15.	In “\subsection{Performance Metrics}”, some metrics are missing, SHAP, ECE, Recall, Precision.
